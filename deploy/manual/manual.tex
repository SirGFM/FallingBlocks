\section*{The... story?}

You find yourself trapped in a tower.

Who trapped you there?

Why?

Where is this tower?

Did the dev just made all this up to pretend the game has some sort
of story?

It's a mystery...

\section*{About the game}

Mystery Tower is a puzzle game in which the player is tasked with
climbing towers.

\includegraphics[width=0.75\paperwidth]{imgs/000-climb-to-goal}

\pagebreak{}

You control a nameless character able to climb, push and pull blocks.
Use these actions to build stairways and bridges, and even to demolish
part of the tower, creating paths toward the goal at the top.

Back in January of 2016, I started making my next ``non-game jam''
game, after JJAT. After almost four years of working on and off on
that project, in July of 2019 I ended up pausing that project to start
Mystery Tower.

What I initially envisioned as being a three months long project ended
up taking almost a full year. I learned a lot of things, had to rewrite
the project once, used an effin' third-party engine, complained a
lot... But had tons of fun!

If you've read this far, thank you! I must also thank friends and
family for always supporting my doing these silly projects, even though
I'm not even that vocal about it (I think?).

Also, special thanks to Pirata/pool\_shark, who pretty much tested
every version of the game, and helped a lot in defining its current
form.
